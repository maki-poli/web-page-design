# web-page-design
Second project for my The Odin Project Journey

This is the project that I am required to fulfill after learning about flexbox.

The participating users for this project are given an image of a website that we have to copy.

For this project, my way of doing this is to first create the html file with all the necessary details and items.

After that, the designing will be done using CSS which I am excited to do.

To be honest, before coming this far, there have been a lot of issues that I had to dealt with and some things concerning my self-esteem.

I thought long and hard if I should still continue because I started The Odin Project 3 or 4 years ago and I am only starting to find my pace.

I've decided to continue this and become a full-fledged web developer no matter what anyone says. Even if people would call me pathetic or that I am not doing it well enough.

I will continue this, no matter what will happen.
